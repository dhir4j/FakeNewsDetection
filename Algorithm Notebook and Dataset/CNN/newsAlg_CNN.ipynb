While the footage was released on Tuesday, the drone was fired on Monday morning and it hit the naval base of Eilat, as confirmed by the Israeli Air Force.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that a drone, apparently launched from Iraq, had struck a building in the naval base of Eilat on Monday morning. According to the IDF, they detected a 'suspicious aerial target' entering Israeli airspace \"from the east\" before impacting \"in the Eilat Bay area.\" The strike caused minor damage to a building in Eilat Bay, with no reported injuries, the IDF stated. Subsequently, the IDF confirmed that the affected building was a hangar at the Eilat naval base.':\n",
